1. Attribute:
<a href="" title="" target="">
title: the title attribute specifies extra information about the link, such as what page is that you are linking to. For example, title = "The Mozilla homepage". This will appear as a tooltip when hovered over. 

target: for example, taget="_blank" will display the link in a new tab. If you want to display the link in the current tab just omit this attribute. 

2. Boolean attributes

<input type="text" disabled> / <input type="text" disabled="disabled">

boolean values can stand without values assigned

3. 
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>My test page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>This is my page</p>
  </body>
</html>

<!DOCTYPE html>: is the shortest string of characters that counts as a valid doctype; that is all you really need to know. 

<html></html>: root element

<head></head>: acts as a container for all the stuff you want to include on the HTML page that isn't the content you are showing to your page's viewers.

<meta charset = "utf-8">: specify the character set your document should use is "UTF-8";

<title></title>: title of the page; visible when loading

<body></body>: contains all the content that you want to show to web users when they visit your page.

<h1>-<h6>: 6 levels; with h1 assigned the most important and h2 assigned the least important

<strong></strong>: has to be meaningful instead of being bold
<em></em>: emphasis instead of <i></i>


4. 
2 types of list
1 - unordered
2 - ordered

5. <div> - a generic container for flow content. It has no effect on the content or layout until styled using CSS.

e.g.

<div>
  <p>Any kind of content here. Such as
  &lt;p&gt;, &lt;table&gt;. You name it!</p>
</div>

styled example:

HTML:

<div class="shadowbox">
  <p>Here's a very interesting note displayed in a
  lovely shadowed box.</p>
</div>

CSS:

.shadowbox {
  border: 1px solid #333;
  box-shadow: 8px 8px 5px #444;
  padding: 8px 12px;
  background-image: linear-gradient(180deg, #fff, #ddd 40%, #ccc);
}

Note: the use of the class attribute on the <div> to apply the style named "shadowbox" to the element.


5. <span></span> - inline elements

6. attributes

format: <tag name="value"></tag>
